In this smart contract, I only implemented the deposit function, so, if user deposit token then the token will get locked. 
As per the question, there is no mention of deposit above 1500, so to overcome this situation, I have created one condition,
if the deposit is greater than 1500 its level is set to 0 and deposit is possible.
